1. Connect USB Cameras and Arduino
2. Check if Arduino is COM3, if not then update in Vision.py
3. Upload Arduino Code
4. If Camera wasn't caliberated already [StereoMap.xml doesn't exist], run images.py to take images of a 10 x 7 chessboard and run Camera_caliberation.py to get Stereo Coefficients
5. Run Vision.py
